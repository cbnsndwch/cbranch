// React Query key convention (docs/spec/15 §2; DECISIONS D9).
//
// Synced data is owned solely by React Query, keyed `[repoId, domain, ...params]` so the
// WebSocket invalidation bus can map a changed `Domain` to the queries to refetch with a
// single `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [repoId, domain] })`. Immutable, content-addressed
// reads (a commit's detail/diff, a blob at a fixed rev) live under non-domain prefixes and
// are NEVER invalidated (spec 15 §8). On reconnect the whole `[repoId]` subtree is
// invalidated (spec 15 §5 / NF-ERR-6).
